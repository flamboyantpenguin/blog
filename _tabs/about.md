## RAVT

Research and Analysis of Various Topics is a collection of records I have written based on my research, analysis and experiences. 

These records are initially derived purely from my own research. This means it would at times lack research and analysis from other sources, unless I have taken directly from them. After an article is written, I plans to start another task of comparing my records with research and analysis available on the internet, after which references will be added to the respective records. 

The records are dynamic, which means they can be updated any time with no ultimate final version for any record. I haven't devised a system yet to track changes, yet you can still view them on GitHub since the blog page source is maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/flamboyantpenguin/blog).

To know more about the intentions behind this project, refer to the article ["Prologue"](https://blog.flamboyantpenguin.in/posts/RAA_Prologue).

## Tech Guides

I also post my experiments, project reports and guides here. You can follow them to understand my way of solving the problems mentioned there and can implement it yourself. While I try my best to make things as easy as possible for one to understand, one must always try to understand the core idea and interpret them oneself. This would perhaps enable one to create an even better solution adapted to pne's environment. 

## Publication Info

These records and experiments are available as a blog on [this site](https://blog.flamboyantpenguin.in) thanks to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Chirpy Jekyll Theme.](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) 

Comments are enabled on the blog page thanks to [giscus](https://giscus.app). Users need to login with a GitHub account to post comments. 

## Author: ペンギン

Hello I am ペンギン ([flamboyantpenguin](https://flamboyantpenguin.in)), an engineering student from India. I'm a curious boi who loves to learn more about this world and life in it.

The world of computer science is an interesting field. The wonderful things we can achieve on a system essentially made of silicon makes one amused. I believe Computer Science is a way of understanding the answer to ultimate questions like the meaning of this world and life as we essentially simulate life itself on the systems we make out of semiconductors.

Philosophy is yet another field I love to talk about. One has to keep in mind that I'm not yet academically educated in the subject which makes me useless in discussing some aspects of the field. Yet I believe I should continue thinking about this world and find answers to questions by my research. Thus, most of the articles here will be my thoughts and research. You can read [prologue](/posts/RAA_Prologue/) to understand my intent.

Currently, I'm pursuing my B. Tech AI & DS Degree from Rajagiri School of Engineering and Technology, Ernakulam. I'm an alumnus of Sainik School Kazhakootam. You can reach me at [mail@flamboyantpenguin.in](mailto:mail@flamboyantpenguin.in).

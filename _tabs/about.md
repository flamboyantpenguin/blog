Hello I am ペンギン ([flamboyantpenguin](https://flamboyantpenguin.in)), an engineering student from India. I'm a curious boi who loves to learn more about this world and life in it.

The world of computer science is an interesting field. The wonderful things we can achieve on a system essentially made of silicon makes one amused. I believe Computer Science is a way of understanding the answer to ultimate questions like the meaning of this world and life as we essentially simulate life itself on the systems we make out of semiconductors.

Philosophy is yet another field I love to talk about. One has to keep in mind that I'm not yet academically educated in the subject which makes me useless in discussing some aspects of the field. Yet I believe I should continue thinking about this world and find answers to questions by my research. Thus, most of the articles here will be my thoughts and research. You can read [prologue](/posts/RAA_Prologue/) to understand my intent.

Currently, I'm pursuing my B. Tech AI & DS Degree from Rajagiri School of Engineering and Technology, Ernakulam. I'm an alumnus of Sainik School Kazhakootam. You can reach me at [mail@flamboyantpenguin.in](mailto:mail@flamboyantpenguin.in).

Research and Analysis of objects and events of any scale is rather interesting and useful.
It enables the observer to understand events/objects and utilize it according to his/her
needs. One of the greatest qualities of humans is this ability, which has enabled us to
understand the order of nature and derive the solutions to our problems with the help
of observed data.

Humans in old age have used this same ability to understand the world around them.
For example, an old age human is well aware of animals living around them and knows
very well about their characteristics and behaviour. While they analysed more about the
nature and surroundings around them for survival, we humans in this age naturally
became concerned over things of the present. For a businessman in this era, analysis of
company profits is inevitable since that helps him/her understand the future of the
company and how to lead the company ahead. A software engineer makes analysis of
software platforms, operating system architectures and possible systems to design
wonderful software. A doctor makes an analysis of diseases and characteristics of
patients to treat the patient better.

While I use the word understand a lot, in this context it means to understand something
really well, possibly deep enough to apply the knowledge one obtains in one’s life.

Research and Analysis is not for complex theories alone. Applying this method in day-to-
day life can transform an individual’s potential to limits beyond unknown. Analysis can
be done from simple questions to complex and intellectual ones. No matter what the
question, analysis proves to be useful for life. So, one might ask: what do I mean by
analysis here? To analyse means to understand something in order to interpret it. To
interpret means to explain the meaning of something in our own terms. In this fast-
paced world, one might be accustomed to score marks in exams by memorising things.
Or in other words, study for the sake of marks. While marks are not unimportant, what’s
truly essential and important is to understand whatever we learn. So, by analysing
something, we understand the topic in our own terms. In our mind, we may do this by
comparing the topic to something we can relate to. Perhaps by mapping examples to
the topic. For this one can research more about a topic more than the bare minimum.
Research a topic online, contemplate about it, discuss with others and question its
elements. See the topic passionately rather than seeing it as a temporary problem to be
solved. Now of course one may not find all topics interesting, in that case one can
consider the topic as a challenge. Now you surely do not want to put a bad game for a
challenge, right?

Now one might ask: what should I analyse? Analyse and question everything one
approach in life. No matter the topic, no matter the importance, no matter how silly,
question everything in life. Never be an NPC (Non-Playable Character). In other words,
always try to understand things you do. We humans are gifted with the ability to
understand things, interpret them and imagine things beyond. As humans became more
civilized over the years with advancements in development, we learned how to override
our inbuilt traits. All creatures have some inbuilt traits to help us survive. While this
perhaps helps us survive, they may not always be ideal at least in this age. We developed
complex emotions and feelings and started caring for others. What this means is that
we learned to override things that were inbuilt in our brain. We were able to step out of
the box and think about things beyond. We humans discovered the phenomenon and
principles of this Universe with this same trait, curiosity. We questioned everything in
life. Why do stars twinkle? Why do we feel happy? Why is the sky blue? Why? What? How?
Question everything you encounter in life. Question not just objects you see, question
yourself. Question your beliefs, question your ideologies and question your thoughts.
This will additionally improve one’s perception as well. Rather than blindly believing in
something, question the belief. Understand its principles. The more you do, the more
blind spots you will cover. The more you will believe in yourself. One reason why one
tends to do things blindly is when one is not aware of the topic. This puts one in a
situation where one is forced to make a choice or opt for the default one. Never let that
happen.

Systematic analysis of data is essential. Recording our silly observations in an orderly
way might seem boring/weird but they can prove to be very useful for finding out the
solutions. Firstly, the moment we move on to a new topic, there is a chance for the old
one to fade. Our mind, though it can store a lot, is hard to manage. It is like a huge
storage system with a file system that is hard to bend the way we want it to. At least not
as easy as creating/deleting a file/folder whenever we want. Our brains store everything
in our mind with links. Every single memory, sense data, emotion and event are
interlinked. These entities get stronger as more links get activated. When we think of
something, the corresponding links get activated creating a chain reaction. Imagine you
are studying about photosynthesis. Now suppose along with it, you studied the structure
of Glucose and Cellulose as well. The moment you start recalling about photosynthesis,
the structure of Glucose and Cellulose will also come to your mind. Take the case of
learning the lyrics of the song, where learning it with the tune helps you remember it
and automatically the next lines come to your mind. Think of it like a path in a forest. The
more the path is used, the more the path becomes clear and devoid of obstacles like
grass. If the path becomes unused, it slowly fades away. In much more simple words,
we remember things more clearly if there are more connections to that particular
memory. This means that there is a possibility of forgetting things outside the currently
running theme in the brain. Hence, it is better to write things down as a record if we ever
need it. One can refer to the record whenever required. Additionally, when one
systematically records observations, one’s mind is forced to rewind the links related to
the topic, subsequently strengthening the connections. Systematic record also forces
one to rethink the event, improving the record slowly. One might see things differently
in different situations. Recording does not have to be in a book. It can be done digitally
too, perhaps as a blog or a typed document. One also does not have to worry much
about references and proof of research. It can be considered if one wishes to make the
record public and as proper research. What’s important is to record and understand
one's thoughts, rest everything comes after this. I myself have not yet started including
research works as proofs for my articles, they shall be done soon.

Interestingly, each human has their own perception of the same event. This means there
is always a chance for humans to have different opinions. This can, of course, cause
conflicts. It depends on us whether to consider this as a problem or a solution. So, if
there is a problem statement, what could be the solution. How can one find the right
opinion/answer if they vary? The answer is perhaps understanding all these different
perceptions. One can perhaps link all the different perceptions of the same event to find
a solution acceptable by all. Perhaps the answer lies within all of them. Now this might
sound stupid, considering how some perceptions are fundamentally different from each
other. One might think it’s almost impossible to accept any such answer. There lies the
beauty of this world. The answers to most questions in this world are not of a single
value. It’s a combination of theories, concepts and values. In some cases, it may be hard
for us to assign a single. In some other cases, the answer is a variable that changes based
on situations. So, what could one do about this? Have a balance of approach. Apart from
one’s own perception, always be willing to understand other’s views. A good discussion
can help us find answers. One should not be an extremist where one believes that one’s
perception is the sole answer. Coordination between human beings has done magic and
is evident when we go through the pages of history of humans. It’s also sad to notice
that humans have fought with each other stupidly over conflicts in perception.

An important step in this is to share knowledge. We humans have the ability to form
social groups and interact with fellow humans in complex ways leading to the
development of a whole subject by itself called sociology. While this is a complex
structure, this perhaps evolved from the basic concept of expecting something in return
of something, or a contract. Over the years humans have found the system of contract
to assign value to items and exchange them fairly. This concept evolved; the system of
money was introduced as the medium of exchange. Knowledge is also something one
obtains with one’s abilities. However, I personally believe that knowledge is not
something one must put a price on. Knowledge is of course valuable, but it should be
freely accessible to all. Homo sapiens greatest ability was to form social connections, or
in other words, work together. This happened only because we were willing to help each
other and work for common benefit. Knowledge is obtained from this world where
everyone lives. Knowledge also has the power to help us understand the world better.
Also considering how knowledge was often spoofed by individuals/groups to trick the
public in their way, everyone must have the right to access knowledge. With knowledge
accessible to all, everyone will be able to express the message themselves and form new
perceptions. We usually tend to opt for the default option when we are not
aware/interested in the different options we have. Knowledge should be a fundamental
right for all humans, for it will help us move forward efficiently and quickly.

In conclusion, analyse and question everything in life. Find answers to everything one
encounters. This attitude can perhaps help us find answers to more complex questions
like the meaning of life, answer to the world and the universe and everything. Record
down one’s thoughts and opinions and finally, share them with the world. These records
of research and analysis are a product of this thought. One simply wishes to share one’s
thoughts, opinions, contemplations and knowledge to foster opportunities for
discussions. One believes this would help one question oneself, understand things
clearly and perhaps find answers for questions we don’t have answers yet. One believes
this would perhaps lay a step towards the goal of making this world a better place to live.

You see what you think you see. So, don’t you feel what you think is important after all?
